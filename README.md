# **Hello there!**


## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I am Ákos Benke, 18 years old, a Front End Web Developer (specializing in React Applications). I am also completing my studies, and I'm looking forward to studying Computer Science.

👨‍💻 I am really enthusiastic about learning new technology. In 2021, I learned React.js, Progressive Web App (PWA), GraphQL. I got started working on big projects to add to my portfolio.

📚 Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to my limits. I'm an athlete, and a member of the Hungarian National Golf Team for the 4th year in a row.
